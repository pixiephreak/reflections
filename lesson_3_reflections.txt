When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories are essential in partner coding and also act as a back up of one's local files. Remote repositories are also usefule
for sharing code or projects with others for their use/review, esp. open source projects. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I guess you could be working on a feature locally that you were'nt ready to share publicly or with your teammates. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use forks when you'd like to play with someone's code without touching their repository. 
Use clones when xxxxxxxxxx you want to collaborate on code with someone...?
Use branches when you want to develop a new expirimental feature.
