 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

 Merging two branches combines the original script with the new additions and omits parts of the script that hae been deleted. It changes script that is altered by a user. I don't know how it handles conflicting changes.
